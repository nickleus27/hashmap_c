# hashmap_c

Making this data structure was fun for me.  I learned a lot about object oriented programming in the C language. Specifically, I learned how to implement polymorphism in C. The HashPair struct and all the struct that inherit from it are polymorphic.  This data structure is not finished at the moment.

This data structure is an unordered map that hashes an integer value as the key and can map to any variety of values.  Right now I have int-string pair and int-double key-value pairs working.  My plan is to also add int-int and int-float as well.
